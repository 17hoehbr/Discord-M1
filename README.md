Should get better battery life and performance out of this compared to the Intel version but of course since this is just running through Electron you will miss out on any features not present in the web version.

Created with the following command:
'nativefier --enable-es3-apis --icon discord.icns --browserwindow-options '{ "fullscreenable": "true", "simpleFullscreen": "false" }' --darwin-dark-mode-support --background-color #36393f https://discord.com/app'
